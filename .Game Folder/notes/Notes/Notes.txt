Alex ToDo:
> test Rula boss fight


Bugs:
	- collisions with screen and walls
	- girls hit earlier than aattack frame animation shows

Fixes:
* Resolution-related picture disruption


Todo#2

Menu 
    After the player beats Rularog, watch’s the cutscenes, and views the Adv Logs, give them a “pop up” message on the “stage select” screen telling them that they get to play Stage 2-1
    Add “sUnlock” to menu screen upon beating a stage

Enemies 
    when enemies are defeated, we want them to “glow” as opposed to changing color completely and turning yellow for a few frames
    Make color of yellow slightly lighter

Rularog 
    When rolling into a wall, give him a little bounce off, similar to Tuffull hitting a wall
    Add SFX_Hitwall when Rula makes contact with the wall
    When Rula is defeated, give the player 160 frames, before taking control away, and have Mein automatically walk to the center of the arena. Then have “seqSS_Awaken01” play

1-3 (Sequences) 
    When Rularog is defeated, have Mein walk to the center of the room automatically. Then have “seqSS_Awaken01” play.
    Have Mein and Sister Spirit do a victory spin together with new “BGM_BossCLEAR01” song playing. Mein will still play a random victory animation.

Mein: 
    When Mein picks up a food items or heals from Bytes, having him glow a light bluish green (#A9F8BC)
    When Mein gains additional HP, have him glow a light green (#FCFFB6)
    Increase Meins grounded attack size horizontally (adjust Chanties attack to  still be larger)

2-1 
    Add 2-1 stage select button to the stage select menu. It will only appear after the player has cleared the boss

ToDo#3
Game functionality 
    finally figure out what is causing the screen tearing and stretching of pixels (the resolution stuff)
    Add the “sUnlock” stage to the menus
    When enemies take damage, have the “sHit” effect sprite show up

Sequences 
    Add SFX to play during sequences in the code

Menus 
    Add all the functionalities to the other options
    adventure logs; should allow you to look at every log you’ve collected. Each log will be in columns of 4. Any logs not collected will be a black silhouette. You can hover over them, but selecting them will cause the “sfx_NA” to play.
    Options; will have things such as will fill out later lol
    Adjust cursor to work better with menus

Mein 
    Add pogo attack and mechanics for stage 2-1, and Mein will have access to this if he revisits older stages as well (check doc for details)

2-1 
    adding the wave attack to the stage (added in part 3 and part 4)

Tre stuff 
    Finish Sister Spirit Temple
    write Adventure logs for Rularog and Naturina ☑️
    Figure out the cutscene for the end of Demo 2
    Create a “Thx for playing” card at the end of demo 2
    Make SFX for SS decent, appearing, unlocking a stage
    Begin play testing 2-1
    Finish tiles for 2-2 and 2-3
