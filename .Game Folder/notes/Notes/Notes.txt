Alex ToDo:
> test Rula boss fight


Bugs:
	- collisions with screen and walls
	- girls hit earlier than aattack frame animation shows

Fixes:
* Resolution-related picture disruption

Refactor:
    1. Move control over all chained sequences into control objects like oTransition
        > victory seqs
        
Misc. 
> SFX in sequences are still weird and annoying, maybe we can work together to figure out an optimal way to handle them?

Check:
> Add pausing to 1-2 part 3 (idk what’s happening here)
> Make sure food and other items land on “thin platforms”
> Add “Sifuud Shores” to the “untitled” text box
> Add 2-1 music to 2-1
> add new “SFX_WindUp” to Tuffulls dash attack startup and Rularogs Tongue attack AND super roll

Fix
> pop up sound plays only for the first message
> hide debug console
> there is an old inifinite cycling in collision
> mein death animation didn't appear after falling in water in log autoscroller just after pinnik fall
> mein doesn't fail in w1_2_end
> Genull description: creature + creature repeat
> unknown symbols in advlogs
> typos in advlogs (rula)
> W2_1 won't unlock
> weid seq audio -> cutdown tree
