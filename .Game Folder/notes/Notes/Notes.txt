Alex ToDo:
Game functionality
//* Camera check; make sure the camera follows the player properly and works with
//  parallax backgrounds properly

Mein: 
//* when taking damage, give the player is given invincibility frames to recover easier 
//* aerial attack damage reduced (8hp->1hp) 
* Allow Mein to Attack after using an aerial attack (when using the aerial attack, 
  the next attack on the ground will not register) 
* Death spin out changes rotation depending on where the player was hit (left or right side) POLISH
* Aerial attack spins based on which way the player is facing; facing right looks perfect
  but facing left look like itâ€™s going backwards POLISH
* Door entrance animation slowed down POLISH

Environments: 
* finish adding backgrounds with P. scrolling to both W1-1 and 1-2 and adjust accordingly 
* Spikes deal 1 damage now, and launch Mein upwards/downwards to avoid multiple hits from them 

Items: 
* Make sure both healing items heal their own amount of HP
