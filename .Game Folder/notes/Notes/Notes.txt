Alex ToDo:
//* Reduce push back/slide when taking damage 
//* Damage animation added 
* Door animation added for entering a door 
//* Reduce Meins double jump height (Initial jump- 3 blocks, double jump-2) 
* Add double jump falling animation 
* Add Mein crouch and hitbox change 
* Pushing animation against walls and objects (like oCutCube) 
* Aerial attack sprite changed for its reduced range, animation lasts as long as the hitbox, and it shouldnâ€™t halt you in place anymore 
* Upon death, Mein should also do a spin out animation
