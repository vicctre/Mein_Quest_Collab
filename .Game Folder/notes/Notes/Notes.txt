Alex ToDo:
> test Rula boss fight


Bugs:
	- collisions with screen and walls
	- girls hit earlier than aattack frame animation shows

Fixes:
* Resolution-related picture disruption

Refactor:
    1. Move control over all chained sequences into control objects like oTransition
        > victory seqs

Check:
> Also, space out the lines of writing so they aren’t so scrunched up together


ToDo:
???
> Change font for menu controls tutorial (or show me how)
???
Menus

Stage Specific
> add “seqMein_WaveIntro” cutscene to 2–1 part 3
> Make sure the “Checkpoint” effect doesn’t appear during the first room of ANY stage, as seen in 2-1, if covers the name
> Meins HP doesn’t seem to carry over between stages. Make it so that he starts the next stage with the same HP he had at the end of the previous.
> make sure the data on the wave counter isn’t shown

Adventure logs 
> Add “pinnik” adventure log page with text. This will be the 2nd log of 2-1 (text and sprite added)

Misc. 
> victory theme/animation is being cut short for some reason, please try to fix
> “Thanks for playing” screen is playing after every stage is complete, please change so it only plays after defeating Rula and make sure it plays the “thx for playing” music
> Add a screen shake effect when Rularog lands during his intro cutscene
> Rula intro sequence is still misplaced (idk why it won’t work properly)


Fix
> there is an old inifinite cycling in collision
> Genull description: creature + creature repeat
> unknown symbols in advlogs
> typos in advlogs (rula)

> coins counter comes to zero after death
> debug drawing for waves
