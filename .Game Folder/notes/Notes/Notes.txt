Alex ToDo:
Mein:
//* Whenever Mein takes damage, the HP bar should do a little shake POLISH 
//* When Mein is landing from a jump, and dashing, small dust effects should appear
//  around and behind him respectively POLISH
//* Fix double jump where Mein seems to be pushed back by a pixel 
//	during the double jump fall animation - can't reproduce
//* adjust crouch hurtbox to have the same width as standing,	
//	but still half the height

Environments: 
//* finish adding backgrounds with P. scrolling to both W1-1 and 1-2 and adjust accordingly 
//* Spikes deal 1 damage now, and launch Mein upwards/downwards to avoid multiple hits from them 
//* when player dies, pause the game for 1 second (60 frames) and then proceed to have the  
//	player fall to their death at full rate (no 30fps slow down anymore)
* Have the “onto stage” sequence play before starting every stage
* Implement Special UI for all Hud elements (discuss fonts and ideas)
* Implement a pause menu, allowing you to “resume” or “quit”
* Make HP bar Draw GUI for easier manipulation 
* Mess around with lighting (shadows) and “fog” to give the backgrounds more depth 
	(See Tre for details and ideas)

Items: 
//* Make sure both healing items heal their own amount of HP
