Game functionality
//* Camera check; make sure the camera follows the player properly and works with
//  parallax backgrounds properly

Mein:
//* when taking damage, give the player is given invincibility frames to recover easier 
//* aerial attack damage reduced (8hp->1hp) 
//* Allow Mein to Attack after using an aerial attack (when using the aerial attack, 
//  the next attack on the ground will not register) 
//* Death spin out changes rotation depending on where the player was hit (left or right side) POLISH
//* Aerial attack spins based on which way the player is facing; facing right looks perfect
//  but facing left look like it’s going backwards POLISH
//* Door entrance animation slowed down POLISH
//* Use new crouch animation
//* use white for iframes blinking

- Fix infinite spawning backgrounds (add some basic colors) 
- Add backgrounds with parallax scrolling to W1-2 
- Spikes now deal 1 damage to the player and launch them upward to prevent players from
  falling into them again 
- when collecting coins, Mein has a little freeze frame, and halts his movement for a second.
  Fix so collecting coins feels smoother 
- Crouching then pressing a direction makes Mein start doing the wrong animation.
  When pushing a direction while crouching, Mein should keep crouching and simply change directions
  he’s facing 
- Adjust Meins acceleration (improve game feel) (Tre) 
- When pushing against a wall and jumping, Mein should not be using his pushing animation
  while jumping POLISH
- Whenever Mein takes damage, the HP bar should do a little shake POLISH 
- When Mein is landing from a jump, and dashing, small dust effects should appear
  around and behind him respectively POLISH

Environments: 
* finish adding backgrounds with P. scrolling to both W1-1 and 1-2 and adjust accordingly 
* Spikes deal 1 damage now, and launch Mein upwards/downwards to avoid multiple hits from them 

Items: 
* Make sure both healing items heal their own amount of HP
