Player sprite collsion mask bounds relative to center:
-12 11
-5 12

Alex ToDo:
//- add the following SFX: Adventure log, Tuffull Roar, @ me for specific details
- When Mein Dies, music should abruptly cut off rather than fading
- When falling into a pit, Mein should still make damage SFX upon death
- All “thin walls” should cast shadows (1-1 room 3) and later rooms
- Make it so shadows are the same as thin wall sprites (more specific @ Tre for this)
- After Tuffull roars, she should idle for a second before starting her attacks, leading 
to the cutscene to last a little longer, with the player unable to act (maybe I should 
lengthen the sequence? Not sure how to go about it)
- During the Tuffull intro sequence, add Boss landing SFX and a slight shake the screen a
 little
- When tuffull is defeated, the game should pause for a second, before she goes flying ba
ck. To further sell the impact, use the “SFX_boss_defeated” SFX after the pause. Also, when 
she lands on the floor, give her the “SFX_Boss_Land” (@ Tre for example video again if you need help)
- ALSO when Tuffull is defeated, make her drop the “Spirit Byte”, landing in the center o
f the screen, floating for the player to collect. Once collected, Mein will drop down and do his
“Victory” sequence
