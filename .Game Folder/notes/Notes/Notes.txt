Fixes
??? Notifications are still not centered on the screen and don’t appear from the bottom of the screen
> there is an old inifinite cycling in collision
	I might have found the line causing this, search for this comment:
	//// Infinite cycle most probably is caused by this
	To reproduce:
	1. Make a room with Mein and log, Mein bbox_bottom is 1 pixel lower 
		than log's bbox_top
	2. Set log's speed to 0 and turn off Mein's gravity
	3. Collide Mein into platform from side

> resolution in non-stage rooms:
    - there are different view sizes - why is that?
    - if we want perfect pixels we have to do the same thing as for stages - change view size
    - try to figure out what is going on in oCamera room create and maybe move resolution handling to a separate object
