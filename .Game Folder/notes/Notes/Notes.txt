Alex ToDo:
> test Rula boss fight


Bugs:
	- collisions with screen and walls
	- girls hit earlier than aattack frame animation shows

Fixes:
* Resolution-related picture disruption

Refactor:
    1. Move control over all chained sequences into control objects like oTransition
        > victory seqs
        
Misc. 
> SFX in sequences are still weird and annoying, maybe we can work together to figure out an optimal way to handle them?
> Add “THANKS FOR PLAYING screen after defeating the boss, similar to the previous demo (room is made and text is written out in creation code)
> Add notification text boxes for Mein getting his new ability AND to notify the player after they defeat Rularog displayed in them☑️
> add “SFX_Notifi” when a pop up appears
> make the pop up appear on the middle of the screen, they will only go away when the player hits the A/enter button
> add new “SFX_WindUp” to Tuffulls dash attack startup and Rularogs Tongue attack AND super roll
> Add new Intro Cutscenes before the title screen and during the initial into cutscene that starts on the first stage

Fix
> pop up sound plays only for the first message
