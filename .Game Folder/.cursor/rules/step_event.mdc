This document describes how to use GameMaker object Step events.
- is executed every game frame
- all the dynamic logic for objects happens here: movement, attacking, collision resolving, complex ai behaviour, animation control (not animation drawing)
- uses methods defined in Create event for changing instance's state
- don't define any functions here
- there are 3 subtypes of Step event: 
    - Step_0 is usual step event
    - Step_1 is begin step event, executed before Step_0
    - Step_2 is end step event, executed after Step_0
    - So overall execution order of step events is: Step_1 -> Step_0 -> Step_2
