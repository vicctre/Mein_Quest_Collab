Menu/UI 
* When player selects something in the menu, make all text go off screen, and Meins icon goes the other way
* Make controller work on title screen by pressing the one of the 4 face buttons or start
* Add unlock sequence for 1-3 as well
* While stage unlock is happening, prevent the player from moving the menu until it’s finished
* Add the unlock SFX to stages being unlocked
> Change Menu controls so that A is to accept instead of X on all menus and B is back as well as esc
* Add text at the left bottom that says the controls for each menu: “select - A/enter” “back - B/esc”

Enemies 
* Double check Chantie is working, for some reason she seems to be broken again
* Make Genull walk SLIGHTLY slower; when I did this, something odd happened where he would get stuck in terrain due to this. Maybe down from 1.5->1.25

Mein stuff 
> When Mein dies from a pit, have the players dead sprite go higher so it’s more visible
* When Dying to the wave attack in 2-1, Meins HP bugs out, fix plz
* Glow Effect should start from 0 and work it’s way to 100 then go back to 0 rather than flashing randomly. It should also only happen once and when Mein isn’t full on HP
> Fix whatever is happening to Mein during idle animations (he fidgets and starts one, only to stop after 1 frame)
> Prevent Mein from starting the victory sequence without being on the ground AND being centered on stage
